      <h2>Socrates: The Unexamined Life</h2>
      <p class="meta">By John Doe | April 2, 2025</p>

      <p>Socrates, the ancient Athenian thinker, left no writings of his own. Yet, through the dialogues of Plato<sup id="ref1">[1]</sup> and the accounts of Xenophon<sup id="ref2">[2]</sup>, he emerges as a figure who reshaped philosophy by questioning everything—and everyone.</p>

      <h3>The Socratic Method</h3>
      <p>At the heart of Socratic philosophy lies <em>elenchus</em>, a method of cooperative argumentative dialogue. Through questions, Socrates led his interlocutors to expose contradictions in their beliefs, pushing them toward deeper understanding—or humble ignorance.</p>

      <h3>Ethics and the Soul</h3>
      <p>For Socrates, virtue was knowledge. He believed that no one does wrong willingly, and that the key to a good life is the health of the soul, achieved through critical self-reflection and pursuit of wisdom.</p>

      <h3>The Trial and Death</h3>
      <p>Accused of corrupting the youth and impiety, Socrates was sentenced to death in 399 BCE. He accepted his fate with calmness, insisting that a true philosopher should not fear death<sup id="ref3">[3]</sup>.</p>

      <blockquote class="floating-quote">
        “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>A challenge that echoes through time, urging us to seek meaning through inquiry and integrity.</p>
